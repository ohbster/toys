nothing serious in here. misc. short programs to help me learn languages and become a better programmer. 
Feel free to comment, leave constructive criticism if you want. 

There is no reason for anyone to clone this repo, cause in all honesty it will be pretty useless to anyone who uses git. 
I hope that, in time, I improve and this repo will help me land a devOps position.

In case you didn't read above, this code was written by someone learning. You use this and break something, don't bother flaming me. Not responsible :)
